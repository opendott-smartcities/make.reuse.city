menu: About
description: <a id="about"></a><strong>TL;DR:</strong> My research is creating ways to promote the reuse of materials in urban contexts. I am organising an <em>online co-design lab</em> in April 2021 (yes, that soon!). If you are reading this, chances are you have something to contribute to the lab. Please <a href="https://forms.gle/rat12rsPstvg89aX9">sign up</a> to one or more virtual workshops, <a href="https://forms.gle/BJoPHMk2NEj1HHxd7">subscribe</a> to learn what I'm planning to do and follow up on that, or just read on below and in my <a href="https://is.efeefe.me/opendott">research blog</a>
