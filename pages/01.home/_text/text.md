  - content: The current focus of my research is to explore ways in which digital technologies might help local interest groups to assess and realise the potential value of second-hand goods. I am considering the possible uses of the Internet of Things - sensors, connected devices, real-time access to trusted databases, among other digital developments - to a) assess the potential value of discarded objects; b) repair and repurpose those objects; c) make those materials reach people or organisations that can put them to good use.

  - content: I'm organising a four-week open lab in April 2021. During that time I expect to co-design speculative experiments about using technologies to assess the potential value of discarded materials. Participation is free and open to anyone interested in contributing.
