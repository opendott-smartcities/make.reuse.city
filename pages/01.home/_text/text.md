  - content: I am investigating how digital technologies can help preventing the generation of waste, by promoting the reuse of materials. My objective is to help assess the potential value of second-hand goods and materials, and establish ways in which that value is realised to the benefit of local societies. My specific focus is on practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation seeking economic as well as social and environmental outcomes.

I will also advance concept ideas related to public infrastructure for waste prevention, and policies to support those ideas.
